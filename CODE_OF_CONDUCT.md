# üìú Code of Conduct  

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Be Cool  
This is a chill space for sharing knowledge, not a battleground. Be excellent to each other.  

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ No Drama, Just Docs  
Disagreements happen, but keep it constructive. If you feel the urge to start a flame war, go roast some marshmallows instead.  

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Respect the No-Sangoma-spiracy Rule  
Yes, we know, corporate things happen. This isn‚Äôt the place to go full conspiracy mode. Stick to the facts and keep the rants fun-sized.  

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Help Out, Don‚Äôt Gatekeep  
Everyone starts somewhere. If someone asks a "dumb question," remember: you probably asked it once, too.  

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ No Trolls, No Gremlins, No Evil AI Overlords  
Good vibes only. If your comment could be mistaken for something a bridge-dwelling creature would say, reconsider.  

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Keep It Legal  
No piracy, no sharing of proprietary or NDA-protected stuff. We love FreePBX, but we also love not getting sued.  

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Give Credit Where Credit Is Due  
If you borrow, remix, or improve on someone‚Äôs work, give them a shoutout. Open source is about collaboration, not theft.  

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Docs, Not Soapboxes  
This repo is for documentation, not personal crusades. If you need to vent, go start a blog.  

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ AI Is a Tool, Not a Source of Truth  
Using AI to generate or fix documentation is fine, but AI **hallucinates**. Always validate anything it generates or corrects to ensure accuracy. If you blindly trust AI, expect to be called out when it spits nonsense.  

## üîü Have Fun!  
At the end of the day, we‚Äôre here to make FreePBX less confusing for everyone. Let‚Äôs enjoy the ride. üöÄ
